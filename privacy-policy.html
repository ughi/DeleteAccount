	<strong>
		 Information Sharing
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	If you agree, we will share your data with our affiliate companies so that they may offer you their products and services. These affiliate companies include Gluwa, Inc. We only collect personal information that we believe to be relevant and required to conduct our business. We may share your personal information with our business partners and service providers, but only to the extent that they each need to know specific information to continue to provide the Platform or services to you. This includes:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Our contractors, employees, service providers, and other third parties that we use to support our business and improve the Platform
	</li>
	<li>
		To our fiduciary and other financial partners to provide the Platform services to you
	</li>
	<li>
		To a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger or reorganization if the personal information of our users is part of the assets transferred
	</li>
	<li>
		To fulfill the purpose for which you provide it
	</li>
	<li>
		To comply with any court order, law, or legal process, including to respond to any government or regulatory request
	</li>
	<li>
		To third party contractors in order to analyze Platform performance and user behavior and/or to improve the Platform
	</li>
	<li>
		If we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of the Platform, our users, or others
	</li>
	<li>
		For any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information
	</li>
	<li>
		With trusted third-party service providers for hosting, analytics, and customer support
	</li>
	<li>
		With other players for public game features such as leaderboards or token transfers where such information sharing is inherent to the gaming experience
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	We may disclose aggregated information about our users, which means information that does not identify any individual, without restriction. As an example, we may include in our marketing materials that a certain percentage of our users are female, but we won't share a list of all female users in these materials.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
		 Data Storage and International Transfers
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	To provide you with the Services described in our Terms of Use, we may securely store, process and transmit information in the United States and locations around the world - including those outside your country. In order to comply with local laws and regulations, we will keep your personal identifying information for seven (7) years from the date you terminate your account. Once this time period has expired, we will delete your data by deleting it from our Postgres relational database and scrubbing it from all third-party systems.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
		 Security
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access. For example, access by a user to his or her personal information is available through a unique customer ID and password selected by the user that should be regularly updated. This information is encrypted through the Platform with Secure Socket Layer technology (SSL) and is also encrypted when it is stored by us to prevent unauthorized parties from viewing such information. Also, we perform regular malware monitoring of the Platform and all servers and computers used by us to support the Platform. All Company employees are required to adhere to our security and confidentiality procedures and undergo training related to maintaining the security of user personal information.
</p>
<p>
	The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where you have chosen a password for access to certain parts of the Platform, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone and be careful about giving out information to other users on the Platform if requested. For cryptocurrency wallet connections, we do not store private keys and are not responsible for wallet security or loss of access to your digital assets. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to the Platform. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Platform.
